Stream :

~ Collection : To Represent group of data/Objects as single entity.
~ Stream     : To Process the data from collection we use streams concepts.
             - Stream provides some methods like filter,map,sorted,limit,distinct and so on,
               by using this methods we can process the data from collection.

-  Filter :
        Filter it means suppose i have some group of collection or data, and by set some condition i want to
        filter that data. so i can use filter.
-  Map    :
        map an intermediate operation.
        First we add collection into stream and then process the data.
        map method will transform the data from source and then we can get it into target.
        In map we read each and every object or element we do some operation and then add it into
            another collection.

- flatMap:
        Basically flatmap() with use for collection of collection, it means group of multiple collections.
        (complex collection)
        if you want to process on collection of collection we will go with flatMap().
        flatMap return multiple values.(stream of object)
